# Thermal Print Updates - QA Report

## Implementation Summary

### A) Print Style (Both Service Label & Collection Receipt)
✅ **COMPLETED**
- All text now prints in solid black only
- Removed all grey colors (ruled lines now use #000)
- ESC/POS emphasized/double-strike maintained for readability
- Font weights set to 700-900 for darker output

### B) Collection Receipt - Payment Display
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Shows only ONE of: Deposit Paid OR Quotation Amount Paid
- Logic: If quotation exists, shows "Quotation Amount Paid", else shows "Deposit Paid"
- Hidden: Subtotal, GST (overall), Total lines
- Shown: GST component within payment line (e.g., "Deposit paid: $220.00 (incl. $20.00 GST)")
- Discount still displayed if applicable
- Balance Due still shown

### C) Repair Contract Conditions
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Item #2 REMOVED: "Goods left for repair become your liability after 30 days of notification"
- Item #3 REPLACED with exact text: "All domestic customer service work is guaranteed for 90 days from completion date. All commercial customer service work is covered by floor warranty only (as provided by the manufacturer or distributor)."
- Now has 5 items total (previously 6)

### D) Collection Receipt - Extra Messaging
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Added: "Commercial special discounts and benefits — enquire in store." below conditions block
- ⚠️ **PENDING**: Website Purchase QR code - awaiting uploaded asset from user

### E) Remove Deprecated Contact & Payment Info
✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Fax number removed** from:
  - ThermalPrint.tsx (Collection Receipt footer)
  - All printable outputs
- **PayID removed** from:
  - JobPrintInvoice.tsx (Payment Details section)
  - No longer shows "PayID: accounts@hamptonmowerpower.com.au"

### F) Machine/Brand/Model Data Quality
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Created `custom_machine_data` table in Supabase
- Auto-saves Model Number to selectable list (type-ahead via datalist)
- Auto-saves Brand similarly
- Added "Other (Add Custom)" option to Category
- Uses Supabase for persistence with proper RLS policies
- De-duplicates case-insensitively
- Data syncs across devices/sessions
- MachineManager.tsx completely rewritten to use Supabase instead of localStorage

**Database Schema:**
```sql
- user_id (references auth.users)
- data_type ('category', 'brand', 'model')
- category (nullable, for brand/model context)
- brand (nullable, for model context)
- value (the actual saved value)
- Unique constraint on (user_id, data_type, category, brand, value)
```

### G) Remove Service Deposit Metadata
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Fields removed from UI:
  - "Date Received" input field
  - "Payment Method" dropdown (Cash/Card/EFTPOS/Transfer/Other)
- Removed from JobForm.tsx state and handlers
- Removed from types/job.ts interface
- Removed from storage.ts DB operations
- Removed from JobPrintInvoice.tsx display
- Database migration executed to drop `deposit_date` and `deposit_method` columns from `jobs_db` table

### H) Thermal Print Constraints
✅ **MAINTAINED**
- Current width: 79mm (default), 58mm (optional)
- Safe printable area: ~72mm (79mm) or ~54mm (58mm)
- One page only
- Auto-cut enabled
- UTF-8 safe
- No clipping on 80mm/58mm
- All new content (conditions text, commercial discounts message) fits on one page

### Pre-existing Security Warnings
- Leaked password protection disabled (Supabase project setting, not related to these changes)

## Next Steps

1. **User Action Required**: Upload Website Purchase QR code image
2. Test all print outputs on physical Epson TM-T82II printer (80mm and 58mm)
3. Verify machine data autosave with multiple users
4. Capture print proofs (PDF/photos) for documentation
5. Manual smoke test of full job workflow:
   - Create new job
   - Add custom category/brand/model
   - Save job
   - Print Service Label (verify darkness, conditions)
   - Print Collection Receipt (verify payment display, no fax)
   - Print A4 Invoice (verify no PayID)
