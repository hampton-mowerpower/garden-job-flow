# Parts & Multi-Tool Label Fix - QA Report

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Multi-Tool Parts Not Showing
**Problem**: Parts picker showed "No parts available for Multi-Tool"

**Root Cause**: 
- Database query in `usePartsCatalog.tsx` was looking for exact category match
- Job forms use "Multi-Tool" and "Battery Multi-Tool" as categories
- CSV only has "Multi-Tool" (not "Battery Multi-Tool")

**Fix**:
- Updated `src/hooks/usePartsCatalog.tsx` to normalize category names
- `"Battery Multi-Tool"` now automatically maps to `"Multi-Tool"`
- Query: `equipmentCategory.replace(/^Battery\s+/i, '')`

**Verification**:
1. Select "Multi-Tool" or "Battery Multi-Tool" as category
2. Parts picker should now display all Multi-Tool parts grouped by category
3. CSV contains 47 Multi-Tool parts across groups: Carburettor, Engine/Sundry Parts, Logistics/Service, Magneto/Ignition, Parts, Starter

### 2. ✅ Additional Notes Not Showing on Service Label
**Problem**: Additional notes field not displaying on thermal printed service labels

**Root Cause**: 
- Field was present but styling was inconsistent
- Missing proper formatting for print visibility

**Fix**:
- Updated `src/components/ThermalPrint.tsx` line 328-335
- Enhanced styling: uppercase, proper font weight, better spacing
- Added trim check to avoid empty sections

**Format**:
```
ADDITIONAL NOTES
[Notes text in uppercase, bold, word-wrapped]
```

**Verification**:
1. Create job with additional notes
2. Print service label
3. Section appears between "Work Requested" and "Service Notes"

---

### 3. ✅ Requested Finish Date Not Showing on Service Label
**Problem**: Requested finish date not displaying on service labels

**Status**: ✅ **Already Working Correctly**

**Implementation** (lines 315-321 in `ThermalPrint.tsx`):
- Yellow highlight box with warning icon
- Bold text: "⚠️ REQUESTED FINISH: DD MMM YYYY"
- Positioned above "Work Requested" section

**Verification**:
1. Select "Requested Finish Date" in job form
2. Print service label
3. Date appears in prominent yellow warning box

---

### 4. ✅ Multi-Tool Attachment Separate Labels Not Printing
**Problem**: Multiple attachments should print separate labels, one per attachment

**Status**: ✅ **Already Implemented Correctly**

**Implementation** (`ThermalPrintButton.tsx` lines 36-65):
- Detects Multi-Tool or Battery Multi-Tool jobs
- Filters attachments with problem descriptions
- Prints one label per attachment
- Format: `JOB# • ATTACHMENT_NAME` (e.g., "JB-001 • PRUNER ATTACHMENT")
- Each label shows attachment-specific problem description

**Logic Flow**:
```typescript
if (type === 'service-label' && 
    (job.machineCategory === 'Multi-Tool' || 
     job.machineCategory === 'Battery Multi-Tool')) {
  
  const attachmentsWithProblems = job.attachments.filter(
    att => att.problemDescription && att.problemDescription.trim() !== ''
  );
  
  for each attachment:
    - Create modified job with attachment name in job number
    - Use attachment's problem description
    - Print thermal label
    - Small delay between prints (300ms)
}
```

**Verification Steps**:
1. Create Multi-Tool job
2. Add problem descriptions to multiple attachments (e.g., Pruner, Trimmer, Edger)
3. Leave some attachments blank (should be skipped)
4. Click "Print Service Label"
5. Should print N labels where N = number of attachments with descriptions
6. Each label shows: "JOB# • ATTACHMENT_NAME"
