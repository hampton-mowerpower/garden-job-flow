## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Old Parts Data**: The old DEFAULT_PARTS and A4_PARTS arrays are still in the codebase but not used in the PartsPicker. They remain for backward compatibility with any existing saved jobs.

2. **CSV Format**: The v16 CSV uses Part Group which is now supported. Ensure Part Group column is present.

3. **Multi-Tool Detection**: Currently detects categories "Multi-Tool" and "Battery Multi-Tool". If there are other multi-tool variants, add them to the detection logic in ThermalPrintButton.tsx line 35.

4. **Password Security Warning**: The Supabase linter shows a warning about leaked password protection being disabled. This is a general Auth setting and doesn't block functionality. Can be enabled in Supabase Auth settings if needed.
