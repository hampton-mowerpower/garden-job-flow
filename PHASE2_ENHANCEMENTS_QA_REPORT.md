- Graceful degradation

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Try popup first
let printWindow = window.open('', '_blank', 'width=800,height=600');

// If blocked, use iframe fallback
if (!printWindow) {
  const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
  iframe.style.display = 'none';
  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
  // ... print via iframe
}
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Supabase Security Warning:** 
The security linter flagged that leaked password protection is disabled. This is a Supabase account-level setting unrelated to this migration. To enable:
1. Visit Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
2. Enable "Password Strength" and "Leaked Password Protection"
3. Docs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security

---

## Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **User Training:** Document the multi-tool label printing workflow
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor customer search performance with large datasets (10,000+ customers)
3. **Print Testing:** Test thermal printing on actual Epson TM-T82II hardware
4. **Backup Strategy:** Ensure `customer_audit` table is included in backup schedules
5. **Customer Merge:** Consider implementing full merge workflow if needed

- Enhanced customer management with edit/delete
