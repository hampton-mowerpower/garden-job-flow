# Customer Duplicate Detection, Multi-Tool Labels & Job Edit Fixes - QA Report

## Implementation Date
October 7, 2025

## Overview
This report documents the implementation and testing of three critical fixes:
1. Customer duplicate detection and merge functionality
2. Multi-tool label printing with separate labels per attachment
3. Job edit persistence ensuring all fields reload correctly
4. Requested Finish Date display on service labels (highlighted)

---

## 1. Customer Duplicate Detection & Merge

### Database Changes
✅ **Migration Completed** - Added:
- `merged_into_id` column to `customers_db` table
- `customer_audit` table for tracking all customer changes (create, update, delete, merge)
- `find_customer_duplicates()` SQL function for efficient duplicate detection
- Index `idx_customers_phone_email` for fast duplicate lookups
- RLS policies for audit logs

### Features Implemented

#### A. Automatic Duplicate Detection
- **Trigger**: On page load and via "Check Duplicates" button in Customer Management
- **Detection Rules**:
  - Strong match: Same phone OR same email (case-insensitive)
  - Excludes soft-deleted customers (`is_deleted = true`)
  - Excludes already-merged customers (`merged_into_id IS NOT NULL`)

#### B. Duplicate Resolution Dialog
Component: `src/components/customers/DuplicateDetectionDialog.tsx`

**Features**:
- Shows all duplicates in a cluster with full details (name, phone, email, created date)
- Radio button to select master record (default: oldest)
- Actions per duplicate:
  - **Keep as Master**: Selected record remains, others merge into it
  - **Delete**: Removes duplicate (soft delete if has history, hard delete if no links)
  - **Merge**: Consolidates all duplicates into master

**Merge Process**:
1. Repoints all foreign keys (FKs) from duplicates to master:
   - `jobs_db.customer_id`
   - `invoices.customer_id`
   - `service_reminders.customer_id`
2. Marks duplicates as `is_deleted = true` and sets `merged_into_id = master.id`
3. Creates audit log entry with before/after snapshots
4. Preserves all historical data under master record

### C. CustomerManager Updates
- Added `checkForDuplicates()` function called on load
- Added "Check Duplicates" button in header with warning icon
- Updated `loadCustomers()` to filter out merged/deleted customers
- Integrated `<DuplicateDetectionDialog>` component

### D. Barry Rickards Cleanup
**One-Time Utility**: `src/utils/cleanupBarryDuplicates.ts`

- Detects all Barry Rickards records (phone: 0418356019, email: barry.rickards1@gmail.com)
- Chooses oldest or correctly-spelled name as master
- Merges all 16 duplicates into single master record
- Normalizes name to "Barry Rickards" (fixes typo "Riccard")
- Can be run from browser console

**Database State Before Fix**:
```
Found 16 duplicate Barry records:
- 1x "Barry Riccard" (typo)
- 14x "Barry Rickards"
- 1x "Barry Rickard"
All with phone: 0418356019, email: barry.rickards1@gmail.com
```

**To Run Cleanup** (Admin only):
```javascript
// In browser console
import('./utils/cleanupBarryDuplicates').then(m => m.cleanupBarryDuplicates())
```

## 2. Multi-Tool Label Printing

### Problem
- Multi-Tool jobs with multiple attachments only printed one label
- Each attachment's problem description was not on separate labels
- Job number wasn't suffixed with attachment name

### Solution
**File**: `src/components/booking/MultiToolLabelPrinter.tsx` (already existed, confirmed working)

**Functionality**:
- Filters attachments where `selected = true` AND `problemDescription` is not empty
- Generates one 79mm label per attachment
- Each label shares the same job number with attachment suffix:
  - Example: `JB2025-0030 • PRUNER`, `JB2025-0030 • TRIMMER`, `JB2025-0030 • HEDGE`
- All labels include:
  - Problem Description (from attachment-specific field)
  - Additional Notes (from job-level field, shown under problem)
  - Requested Finish Date (highlighted in yellow box)

**Label Content Order** (79mm):
1. Company header (Hampton Mowerpower)
2. Job Number (bold) with attachment suffix
3. Customer Name & Phone
4. Machine Category / Brand / Model
5. **Problem Description** (attachment-specific)
6. **Additional Notes** (directly under problem, no truncation except ellipsis)
7. **Requested Finish Date** (bold, bordered, yellow background if present)
8. Staff Notes (if any)
9. QR Code for tracking
10. Footer

### Label Template Updates
**File**: `src/components/labels/ServiceLabel79mm.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Moved Requested Finish Date rendering to after Additional Notes
- Applied highlighting: 2px black border, yellow background, bold text with warning icon
- Ensured Additional Notes appear directly under Problem Description
- Format: `⚠ REQUESTED FINISH: DD MMM YYYY`

---

## 3. Job Edit Persistence Fix

### Problem
- Editing job JB2025-0030 caused fields to disappear
- Multi-Tool attachments not loading
- Requested Finish Date not persisting
- Additional Notes not reloading

### Root Cause
Job loading function `mapJobFromDb()` in `src/lib/storage.ts` was missing Phase 2 fields:
- `additionalNotes`
- `requestedFinishDate`
- `attachments`
- Transport fields
- Sharpen fields

### Solution
**File**: `src/lib/storage.ts` - Updated `mapJobFromDb()`

**Added Fields**:
```typescript
additionalNotes: jobData.additional_notes || '',
requestedFinishDate: jobData.requested_finish_date || undefined,
attachments: jobData.attachments || [],
transportPickupRequired: jobData.transport_pickup_required || false,
transportDeliveryRequired: jobData.transport_delivery_required || false,
transportSizeTier: jobData.transport_size_tier || undefined,
transportDistanceKm: jobData.transport_distance_km || undefined,
transportTotalCharge: jobData.transport_total_charge || 0,
transportBreakdown: jobData.transport_breakdown || '',
sharpenItems: jobData.sharpen_items || [],
sharpenTotalCharge: jobData.sharpen_total_charge || 0,
sharpenBreakdown: jobData.sharpen_breakdown || ''
```

**Result**: All fields now persist correctly on save and reload accurately on edit.

## Known Limitations

1. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Does not use fuzzy name matching (e.g., "Barry Rickards" vs "Barry Riccard" won't match unless phone/email identical)
   - Enhancement: Add Levenshtein distance for name similarity (≥0.9 threshold)

2. **Multi-Tool Labels**:
   - Prints sequentially with 300ms delay between labels
   - If printer is offline, may queue all labels

3. **Performance**:
   - `find_customer_duplicates()` runs on entire `customers_db` table
   - Recommend periodic cleanup of soft-deleted records

---

## Security Considerations

✅ **Audit Trail**: All merges/deletes logged to `customer_audit` with:
- Action type (created, updated, deleted, merged)
- Timestamp and user ID
- Before/after snapshots (JSONB)

✅ **RLS Policies**:
- Only authenticated users can view audit logs
- Only admin/counter roles can insert audit entries
- Customer merge operations require admin/counter role

✅ **Soft Delete**: Customers with history are never hard-deleted, ensuring data integrity

## Deployment Notes

### Feature Flags
- `customer_dedupe_enforcement` - Enable duplicate detection on load
- `booking_labels_multitool_fix` - Enable multi-tool label printing

### Rollback Plan
1. Toggle feature flags off
2. Revert migration if needed (drop `customer_audit`, remove `merged_into_id` column)
3. Restore previous `CustomerManager.tsx` and `ServiceLabel79mm.tsx`

### Post-Deployment
1. Run Barry Rickards cleanup utility (admin only)
2. Monitor `customer_audit` table for merge activity
3. Check for duplicate detection performance impact (should be negligible)
