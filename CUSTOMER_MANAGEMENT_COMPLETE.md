## Date: 2025-10-07

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive customer management system with duplicate detection, unified customer profiles with complete service history, enhanced Quick Select with server-side search, and verified Multi-Tool label printing.

---

## A) Database Changes ✅

### Migration Applied
- **Indexes Created:**
  - `idx_customers_name_lower` - Case-insensitive name search
  - `idx_customers_email_lower` - Case-insensitive email search
  - `idx_customers_phone` - Phone number search
  - `idx_customers_name_postcode` - Composite index for fuzzy matching
  - `idx_jobs_customer_id` - Fast customer history queries

- **New Columns:**
  - `is_deleted` (BOOLEAN) - Soft delete support
  - `suburb` (TEXT) - For better duplicate detection
  - `postcode` (TEXT) - For geographic matching

- **Database Function:**
  - `fn_search_customers(search_query, limit_count, offset_count)` - Server-side search with pagination

## G) Security Notes

### Warning Acknowledged
- **Issue:** Leaked password protection disabled (Supabase auth)
- **Level:** WARN (not critical for current implementation)
- **Recommendation:** User should enable in Supabase dashboard → Auth → Password settings
- **Impact:** Does not affect customer management features
- **Action:** Notify user to enable as best practice

### RLS Policies
All customer data protected by Row Level Security:
- Authenticated users can view customers
- Admin/Counter roles can edit/delete
- Audit logs track all changes
- Soft deletes preserve data integrity

---

## H) Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Merge functionality requires manual selection (no auto-merge)
2. Duplicate detection is reactive (on create) not proactive (scheduled job)
3. Customer search limited to 50 results (can be increased)

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Auto-merge suggestions** - AI-powered duplicate resolution
2. **Bulk operations** - Merge multiple duplicates at once
3. **Customer tagging** - Categorize customers (VIP, wholesale, etc.)
4. **Email templates** - Pre-configured reminder messages
5. **Export history** - PDF/Excel export of customer activity
