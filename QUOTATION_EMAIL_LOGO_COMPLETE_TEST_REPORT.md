```

## 2. Quotation Fee Deduction in PDFs ‚úÖ

### Implementation
- **File**: `supabase/functions/send-email-with-attachment/pdf-generator.ts`
- **Logic**: When `isQuotation && quotationAmount > 0`, shows deduction line

### PDF Display
```
Subtotal (ex GST):        $165.45
GST (10%):                $16.55
Total (inc. GST):         $182.00
Quotation Fee (deducted): -$50.00
Amount Payable:           $132.00 (inc. GST)
```

### Updated Interfaces
Added `quotationAmount` field to:
- `JobData` interface in `pdf-generator.ts`
- `EmailRequest` interface in `send-email-with-attachment/index.ts`
- Email notification payload in `EmailNotificationDialog.tsx`

---

## 3. "Approve Quotation" Button Workflow ‚úÖ

### Components Created

#### A. Edge Function: `supabase/functions/approve-quotation/index.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handle quotation approval
- **Security**: Public function (no JWT required for customer access)
- **Features**:
  - Verifies job exists
  - Checks if already approved
  - Updates `quotation_status` to 'approved'
  - Sets `quotation_approved_at` timestamp
  - Saves customer note to `additional_notes`
  - Logs audit entry

#### B. Approval Page: `public/approve-quotation.html`
- **Standalone HTML**: No React Router needed
- **URL Format**: `/approve-quotation.html?job={jobId}&email={email}`
- **Features**:
  - Approval form with optional customer note
  - Success state with job number
  - Already approved handling
  - Error state for invalid links
  - Company branding footer
  - Uses Supabase JS client via ESM

#### C. Email Button
Updated email template to include:
```html
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <a href="{approveUrl}" style="display: inline-block; background: #2563eb; color: white; 
     padding: 14px 32px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px;">
    Approve Quotation
  </a>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px; color: #6b7280; font-size: 13px;">
    Click the button above to approve this quotation
  </p>
</div>
```

### Email Display Update
Shows deduction in job details box:
```html
Total:                      $182.00 (inc. GST)
Quotation Fee (deducted):   -$50.00
Amount Payable:             $132.00 (inc. GST)
```

### Configuration
Added to `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[functions.approve-quotation]
verify_jwt = false
```

---

## 4. Auto-Capitalization ‚úÖ

### Implementation
Added `onBlur` handlers with `toTitleCase()` to capitalize first letter of each word:

#### Files Modified:
1. **src/components/JobForm.tsx**
   - Company Name field (line 1026)

2. **src/components/booking/CustomerAutocomplete.tsx**
   - Customer Name field (line 277-282) - Already implemented
   - Address field (line 313-318) - New

### Capitalization Logic
```typescript
onBlur={(e) => {
  const formatted = toTitleCase(e.target.value);
  if (formatted !== e.target.value) {
    onCustomerChange({ ...customer, name: formatted });
  }
}}
```

### Persistence
- Capitalizes on blur (when user leaves field)
- Saves capitalized value to Supabase
- Persists across page refreshes
- Handles special cases: O'Brien, MacDonald, hyphenated names

---

## 5. Service Label Company Name ‚úÖ

### Status: Already Working Correctly
File: `src/components/labels/ServiceLabel79mm.tsx` (lines 84-86)

### Display Logic
```tsx
{job.jobCompanyName && (
  <div className="text-sm font-semibold mt-1">{truncate(job.jobCompanyName, 35)}</div>
)}
```

### Label Structure
```
[Customer Name]
üè¢ COMMERCIAL (or üè† DOMESTIC)
[Company Name] ‚Üê Displayed here
[ACCOUNT CUSTOMER badge if applicable]
[Phone]
```

### Verified Working
- Shows company name when `job.jobCompanyName` exists
- Displays customer type badge (Commercial/Domestic)
- Shows Account Customer badge when linked
- No labor charges displayed on label
