# Implementation Summary: Email Templates, Auto-Print Fix, and Quotation T&Cs

## Changes Implemented

### 1. âœ… Printing Behavior Fixed

**JobForm.tsx** (lines 783-790):
- **NEW JOBS**: Auto-print collection receipt on first save (existing behavior maintained)
- **EDIT JOBS**: Show manual print dialog (PrintPromptDialog) instead of auto-printing
- The dialog offers checkboxes for Service Label and Collection Receipt (user choice)

**Result**: No auto-printing when editing jobs; only manual print options shown.
