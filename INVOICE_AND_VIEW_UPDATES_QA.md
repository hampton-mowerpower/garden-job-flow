# Invoice Itemization & View Button Fix - QA Report

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Invoice - Full Itemized Charges ✅

**Changes Made:**
- Updated table columns from: `Item | Description | Qty | Unit (ex GST) | GST % | Line Total`
- To: `Type | Description | Qty/Hours | Unit Price | Line GST | Line Total`

**Grouping Structure:**
```
PARTS (group header)
  - Part 1: [Type: Parts] [Description] [Qty] [Unit Price] [Line GST] [Line Total]
  - Part 2: ...
  Parts Subtotal (ex GST): $XXX.XX

LABOUR (group header)
  - Labour: [Type: Labour] [Service & Repair Work] [Hours] [Unit Price] [Line GST] [Line Total]
  Labour Subtotal (ex GST): $XXX.XX
```

**Totals Section:**
```
Subtotal (Parts + Labour, ex GST):  $XXX.XX
Discount (if any):                  -$XX.XX
GST Total (sum of line GST):        $XX.XX
Grand Total (inc GST):              $XXX.XX
Deposit Paid (if any):              -$XX.XX
Balance Due:                        $XXX.XX
```

**Calculations:**
- Line Total = Qty × Unit Price (ex GST)
- Line GST = Line Total × 0.1 (rounded to 2dp)
- Parts Subtotal = Sum of all part line totals (ex GST)
- Labour Subtotal = Labour line total (ex GST)
- GST Total = Sum of all line GST values
- Grand Total = (Parts + Labour - Discount) × 1.1
- Balance Due = Grand Total - Deposit Paid

**Formatting:**
- Group headers have grey background (#F8FAFC) and border
- Subtotal rows have light grey background (#F1F5F9)
- All rows use `breakInside: avoid` and `pageBreakInside: avoid` to prevent splits
- Table headers repeat on multi-page invoices (CSS print rules)

### 2. Shop Logo Applied ✅

**Changes Made:**
- Copied `logo.jpg` to `src/assets/hampton-logo-new.jpg`
- Updated `JobPrintInvoice.tsx` to use the new logo
- Logo displays at top-left of invoice header
- Logo scales properly for print and PDF output

### 3. QR Code on Collection Receipt ✅

**Changes Made:**
- Copied `hampton_code.png` to `src/assets/hampton-qr-code.png`
- Updated `ThermalPrint.tsx` to embed QR code in Collection Receipt
- QR code converts to base64 for inline embedding (print-safe)
- Positioned below "Commercial special discounts" message
- Size: 30mm × 30mm (79mm printer) or 25mm × 25mm (58mm printer)
- Fits on single page without causing page break

### 4. View Button Fixed ✅

**Problem Identified:**
- View button called `onSelectJob(job)` which set `activeView = 'dashboard'`
- This only showed a summary card on dashboard, not full job details
- Users expected a dedicated view mode similar to Edit

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added new `'view'` state to `activeView` type
- `handleSelectJob` now sets `activeView = 'view'` instead of 'dashboard'
- Created dedicated view mode that displays full `JobForm` in read-only context
- View mode has "Back to Search" button that returns to search page
- View mode shows job number in header: "Job Details - #12345"

**User Flow:**
1. User searches for jobs in Search & Manage Jobs
2. Click "View" button on any job
3. Full job details load in view mode (using JobForm component)
4. All fields visible: customer info, machine details, parts, labour, pricing, staff notes
5. User can print from this view (Invoice, Service Label, Collection Receipt)
6. Click "Back to Search" returns to job list with filters preserved

## Files Modified

   - Updated table structure with new columns

   - Added `getQRCodeBase64` helper function
   - Updated `generateCollectionReceiptHTML` to accept and embed QR code

5. **src/pages/Index.tsx**
   - Added `'view'` to `activeView` type union
   - Updated `handleSelectJob` to navigate to view mode
   - Created dedicated view mode section
   - View mode renders `JobForm` with selected job
   - "Back to Search" button returns to search page

## Testing Checklist

### Invoice Itemization
- [ ] **Column Headers**: Type | Description | Qty/Hours | Unit Price | Line GST | Line Total
- [ ] **Parts Grouping**: "PARTS" header, all parts listed, "Parts Subtotal" row
- [ ] **Labour Grouping**: "LABOUR" header, labour entry, "Labour Subtotal" row
- [ ] **Line GST Calculation**: Each line shows GST = (Qty × Unit Price) × 0.1, rounded to 2dp
- [ ] **Totals Accuracy**:
  - Parts Subtotal = sum of part line totals
  - Labour Subtotal = labour line total
  - GST Total = sum of all line GST values
  - Grand Total = (Parts + Labour - Discount) × 1.1
  - Balance Due = Grand Total - Deposit Paid
- [ ] **Discount Display**: Shows discount row if discount > 0, correctly calculated
- [ ] **Formatting**: Group headers have grey background, no line splits across pages
- [ ] **Multi-page**: Header rows repeat on page 2+ if invoice spans multiple pages
- [ ] **PDF Export**: Invoice prints correctly to PDF with all formatting intact

### Logo & QR Code

## Math Verification Examples

### Example 1: Single Part + Labour
```
Part: Air Filter × 2 @ $11.00 (ex GST) = $22.00
  Line GST: $2.20
  Line Total: $22.00

Labour: 1.5h @ $60.00/h (ex GST) = $90.00
  Line GST: $9.00
  Line Total: $90.00

Parts Subtotal: $22.00
Labour Subtotal: $90.00
Subtotal (ex GST): $112.00
GST Total: $11.20 (sum of line GST: $2.20 + $9.00)
Grand Total: $123.20
Deposit Paid: -$50.00
Balance Due: $73.20
```

### Example 2: Multiple Parts + Discount
```
Part 1: Spark Plug × 1 @ $8.00 = $8.00 (GST $0.80)
Part 2: Oil Filter × 1 @ $15.00 = $15.00 (GST $1.50)
Part 3: Chain × 2 @ $25.00 = $50.00 (GST $5.00)

Parts Subtotal: $73.00
Labour: 2h @ $70.00/h = $140.00 (GST $14.00)
Labour Subtotal: $140.00

Subtotal (ex GST): $213.00
Discount (10%): -$21.30
After Discount: $191.70
GST Total: $19.17 (sum of line GST: $0.80 + $1.50 + $5.00 + $14.00 - discount GST)
Grand Total: $210.87
Deposit: -$100.00
Balance Due: $110.87
```

## Known Issues

### Pre-existing
- Security linter warning about leaked password protection (Supabase project setting, unrelated to these changes)

### New Issues
- None identified during implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Physical Testing**:
   - Print invoice to actual printer (not just PDF)
   - Print thermal receipts on Epson TM-T82II (80mm and 58mm)
   - Scan QR code to verify it works

2. **User Acceptance**:
   - Have user test View button workflow
   - Verify invoice layout meets requirements
   - Confirm all math calculations are accurate

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guide for View vs Edit modes
   - Document QR code update process for future changes
   - Add screenshots to this QA report

4. **Automated Tests** (Future):
   - Unit tests for Line GST calculations
   - Integration tests for View button navigation
   - E2E test: search → view → print → back
