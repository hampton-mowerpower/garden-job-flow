## üö® FAILURE SCENARIOS

### If Jobs Don't Load
**Symptoms**: Blank job list, red toast "API connection failed"

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red errors
3. Check Network tab ‚Üí Filter by "jobs" ‚Üí Look for failed requests
4. Go to System Doctor ‚Üí Run Full Diagnostic
5. If any test fails, note the exact error message

**Common Causes**:
- RPC function `list_jobs_page` doesn't exist (Solution: use JobListReliable component)
- Network connectivity issue (Solution: check internet, refresh page)
- Supabase project paused (Solution: wake up project in Supabase dashboard)

### If Parts Don't Persist
**Symptoms**: Parts save successfully but disappear after refresh

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí `job_parts`
2. Filter by `job_id` = [your test job ID]
3. Check if parts rows exist in database
4. If rows exist but don't load ‚Üí problem is in fetch logic
5. If rows don't exist ‚Üí problem is in save logic

**Common Causes**:
- Parts being deleted immediately after save
- Totals not updating so app thinks save failed
- Transaction rollback due to job update error

### If Customer Profile Shows Wrong Jobs
**Symptoms**: Customer profile job count doesn't match Job Search

**Debug Steps**:
1. Note customer ID from customer profile URL or database
2. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
3. Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs_db WHERE customer_id = '[customer-id]' AND deleted_at IS NULL`
4. Compare count with what profile shows
5. If count is different, check Customer Profile query logic
