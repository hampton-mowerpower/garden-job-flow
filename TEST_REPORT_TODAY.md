# System Recovery Test Report

**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Status:** üî¥ IN PROGRESS - API DOWN  
**Test Suite:** Complete System Health Check

---

## Current Status

### Critical Issue
- **API Status:** üî¥ UNHEALTHY
- **Error Code:** PGRST002 - "Could not query the database for the schema cache"
- **Impact:** Job Search, Job Details, and all data operations are non-functional

### Root Cause
PostgREST (Supabase's API layer) cannot read its internal schema cache table. This prevents ALL API calls from working.

---

## Recovery Steps Taken

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Created EMERGENCY_SQL_FIX_V2.sql
- Comprehensive recovery script with:
  - Schema reload notifications
  - Full permission grants for anon, authenticated, service_role
  - Broken view detection and logging
  - Health check function creation
  - Permission verification
- **Location:** Project root directory

### ‚è≥ Step 2: Awaiting Manual Execution
**ACTION REQUIRED:** Run EMERGENCY_SQL_FIX_V2.sql in Supabase SQL Editor

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kyiuojjaownbvouffqbm/sql/new
2. Copy entire contents of EMERGENCY_SQL_FIX_V2.sql
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Wait for "RECOVERY COMPLETE" message
6. Wait 10 seconds for PostgREST to reload
7. Test health check in app

## Test Results (Will Update After Recovery)

### üî¥ Critical Tests - NOT TESTED (API Down)
- [ ] Job Search loads with data
- [ ] Job Details page opens
- [ ] Customer ‚Üí Jobs tab shows data
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Status updates work

### üî¥ Admin Tools - NOT TESTED (API Down)
- [ ] System Doctor health checks pass
- [ ] Data Forensics loads
- [ ] Reload API Schema button works

### üî¥ Data Integrity - NOT TESTED (API Down)
- [ ] Carrie profile shows only JB2025-0061
- [ ] job0028 linked to Stephen Swirgoski

---

## Expected Results After Running SQL Fix

### ‚úÖ Immediate (within 10 seconds)
1. PostgREST schema cache reloaded
2. All permissions granted to API roles
3. Health check function callable
4. API returns 200 OK on queries

### ‚úÖ UI Recovery (after page reload)
1. Job Search displays job list
2. No red error toasts
3. Job Details pages open
4. System Doctor shows all green

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If Still Failing
Check SQL output for:
- Broken views (will show specific view name + error)
- Permission errors (will show which table/operation failed)
- Function compilation errors

---

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Run EMERGENCY_SQL_FIX_V2.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Verify:** Check SQL output shows "RECOVERY COMPLETE"
3. **Test:** Wait 10 seconds, then click "Check Health" in app
4. **Confirm:** Health status should show "Healthy"
5. **Full Test:** Navigate to Job Search - should load data
6. **Report:** Update this document with actual test results

## Technical Details

### Error Analysis
```
Error: PGRST002
Message: "Could not query the database for the schema cache. Retrying."
Frequency: Every API call
Components Affected: All (Job Search, Details, Stats, Admin tools)
```

### Why This Happened
PostgREST maintains an internal cache of the database schema. When it cannot query this cache:
1. Recent schema changes (views, functions, tables) may have broken something
2. Permissions on internal tables might be insufficient
3. A view with ambiguous columns might be blocking schema introspection
4. Search path issues in SECURITY DEFINER functions

### The Fix
The V2 script:
1. Forces schema reload via pg_notify
2. Grants comprehensive permissions on ALL objects
3. Tests every view for compilation errors
4. Creates simple health check functions
5. Verifies permissions post-fix
6. Provides diagnostic output for debugging

## Sign-Off

### After Recovery (To Be Completed)
- [ ] All critical tests pass
- [ ] Screenshots captured (Job List, Job Details, System Doctor)
- [ ] Root cause documented
- [ ] Preventive measures in place
- [ ] System marked as HEALTHY
