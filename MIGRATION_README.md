# 🔄 Supabase Project Migration Guide

## Overview
This project has been successfully migrated from the old Supabase project to a new one:

- **Old Project**: `kyiuojjaownbvouffqbm.supabase.co`
- **New Project**: `zqujcxgnelnzxzpfykxn.supabase.co` ✅

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Configuration Updated
All app configuration now points to the new Supabase project:

- ✅ `.env` - Updated with new project URL and anon key
- ✅ `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Updated Supabase client config
- ✅ `supabase/config.toml` - Updated project ID

### 2. Secrets Configured
The following secrets have been securely stored in Lovable:

- `OLD_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For reading from old database
- `NEW_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For writing to new database

### 3. Database Schema Created
The new Supabase project has been initialized with:

- `customers_db` table with all required columns and indexes
- `user_profiles` table for authentication and roles
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured
- Database triggers for normalization and timestamps
- Helper functions for role-based access control

### 4. Migration Tool Deployed
An automated migration edge function has been deployed:

- Location: `supabase/functions/migrate-customers/`
- Endpoint: `https://zqujcxgnelnzxzpfykxn.supabase.co/functions/v1/migrate-customers`
- Admin UI: Available in app at Navigation → "Migration Admin"

## 🚀 How to Run the Migration

### Step 1: Access the Migration Admin Page
1. Log in to the application
2. Click "Migration Admin" in the navigation menu (admin-only)

### Step 2: Run the Migration
1. Click the "Run Customer Migration" button
2. Wait for the process to complete (typically 1-5 minutes depending on data volume)
3. Review the migration statistics and sample records

### Step 3: Verify Results
The migration tool automatically provides:

- **Statistics**: Total read, inserted, skipped, deduplicated
- **Sample Records**: First 10 customers for spot-checking
- **Export Counts**: Before/after record counts
- **Downloadable Report**: Full JSON report of the migration

## 📊 Migration Features

### Automatic Deduplication
The migration tool automatically:

- Detects duplicates by email (case-insensitive) or phone
- Keeps the most recently updated record
- Skips soft-deleted customers (`is_deleted = true`)
- Normalizes data (trims whitespace, lowercase emails, etc.)

### UUID Preservation
- Original customer UUIDs are preserved
- Related records will maintain referential integrity
- No need to update foreign keys

### Safety Features
- Read-only connection to old database (uses service role)
- Idempotent operation (safe to run multiple times)
- Batch processing (handles large datasets)
- Comprehensive error logging

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Current configuration:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://zqujcxgnelnzxzpfykxn.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=zqujcxgnelnzxzpfykxn
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=eyJhbGci... (anon key)
```

**Secrets** (managed by Lovable, not in .env):
- `OLD_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEW_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 🔐 Security Notes

### RLS Policies
The new database has simplified RLS policies:

- All authenticated users can perform CRUD operations
- Consider tightening policies based on user roles after migration
- Role-based access control is available via `has_role()` and `has_any_role()` functions

### Service Role Keys
- Service role keys are only used in server-side edge functions
- Never exposed to client-side code
- Stored securely in Lovable secrets

## 📝 Post-Migration Checklist

After running the migration:

- [ ] Verify customer count matches expectations
- [ ] Test customer search functionality
- [ ] Test customer edit/save functionality
- [ ] Check for any duplicate records
- [ ] Review migration report for errors
- [ ] Test authentication and user roles
- [ ] Update any remaining old project references

## 🔄 Re-Running the Migration

The migration is **idempotent** and can be safely re-run:

```
1. Navigate to Migration Admin
2. Click "Run Customer Migration"
3. Review new results
```

The tool will:
- Upsert records (update if exists, insert if new)
- Skip duplicates based on latest logic
- Generate new statistics and report

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails with "Connection Timeout"
- The new Supabase project may still be initializing
- Wait 2-3 minutes and try again
- Check Supabase dashboard for project status

### Duplicate Records After Migration
- Review the deduplication logic in `supabase/functions/migrate-customers/index.ts`
- Run migration again with stricter deduplication rules
- Manually merge duplicates using customer management tools

### Missing Customers
- Check the "Skipped (Deleted)" count in migration stats
- Verify customers were not soft-deleted in old database
- Review migration errors in the downloadable report

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure user profiles exist in `user_profiles` table
- Verify RLS policies allow your user's role
- Check Supabase auth settings in dashboard

## 🔄 Rotating Keys

To rotate Supabase keys:

1. Generate new keys in [Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zqujcxgnelnzxzpfykxn/settings/api)
2. Update `.env` file with new anon key
3. Update Lovable secrets with new service role key
4. Redeploy edge functions if needed
