## Summary of Changes

### 1. Service Label Improvements

  - Implemented automatic parsing by comma, semicolon, and newline delimiters
  - Added deduplication logic to remove repeated items
  - Each request now renders on its own line in ALL CAPS
  - Example: "Full Service Required, Won't Start, Runs Rough" → separate lines
- **PARTS REQUIRED awkward wrapping:**
  - Changed format from comma-separated to one line per part
  - Format: `PART NAME ×QTY` (e.g., "2-STROKE OIL 1L ×1")
  - Each part displays on its own line within safe print area

#### Typography Enhancements:
- Increased header font sizes for better hierarchy
