# üö® URGENT DATA INTEGRITY AUDIT - October 2025
## Complete Forensic Analysis & Recovery Report

**Report Generated:** October 15, 2025  
**Audit Period:** Last 30 days (Sept 15 - Oct 15, 2025)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ STABILIZED - Read-only mode active for non-admins

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Job 0061**: Customer link incorrectly changed from "Carrie (Wood Culture Services)" to "Gaye Moody"
2. **Job 0042**: Complete data loss - all parts and cost totals reset to zero
3. **Job 0065**: Previously affected, now verified correct
4. **Systemic Issues**: 20+ jobs with calculation discrepancies (GST not included in stored totals)

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Delete-Then-Insert Pattern** (Lines 320-373 in storage.ts):
   - Parts are deleted BEFORE inserting new parts
   - If save occurs with empty/undefined parts array, ALL parts are lost
   - No transaction protection - partial failures leave database in inconsistent state

2. **No Optimistic Concurrency Control**:
   - Version column exists but never validated
   - Concurrent edits silently overwrite each other
   - No conflict detection or resolution UI

3. **No Parts Audit Trail** (until this fix):
   - Part deletions were not logged
   - No way to recover lost parts data
   - Audit triggers only covered jobs/customers tables

4. **Customer Deduplication Logic**:
   - Phone-only matching can incorrectly merge customers
   - No validation when customer data is edited
   - Silent customer link changes without user confirmation

### Impact Assessment
- **Jobs Affected**: 3 confirmed (0061, 0042, 0065), 20+ with calculation drift
- **Data Recoverable**: Job 0061 ‚úÖ, Job 0065 ‚úÖ (already done)
- **Data Lost**: Job 0042 parts/totals (no audit trail exists - requires manual re-entry)
- **Business Impact**: Medium - customer confusion, incorrect billing, lost revenue tracking

## DETAILED FORENSIC FINDINGS

### Case 1: Job 0061 - Incorrect Customer Link
**Timeline:**
- **Original:** Carrie, 0422408306 (Wood Culture Services)
- **Incorrect:** Gaye Moody, 0395984896 (Also Wood Culture Services)
- **Current:** ‚úÖ Restored to Carrie, 0422408306

**Root Cause:**
- "Gaye Moody" customer record has `company_name = 'Wood Culture Services'`
- Customer matching logic matched by company name instead of phone
- No validation when customer link changed

**Recovery Action:**
- Created/verified "Carrie" customer with correct phone
- Relinked Job 0061 to correct customer
- Logged recovery in `customer_change_audit`

**Verification SQL:**
```sql
SELECT j.job_number, c.name, c.phone, c.company_name
FROM jobs_db j
JOIN customers_db c ON c.id = j.customer_id
WHERE j.job_number = 'JB2025-0061';
-- Result: Carrie, 0422408306, Wood Culture Services ‚úÖ
```

### Case 2: Job 0042 - Complete Data Loss
**Timeline:**
- **Before:** Had line items and cost totals (exact values unknown - no audit)
- **After:** grand_total=0, parts_subtotal=0, labour_total=0, 0 parts records

**Root Cause:**
- `saveJob()` called with `job.parts = []` or `undefined`
- Lines 320-324: ALL existing parts deleted
- Lines 367-372: No parts inserted (array was empty)
- No transaction protection - delete succeeded, insert skipped

**Audit Trail Analysis:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_log 
WHERE record_id = '773550f2-0851-4654-8269-cabb1c33db4f';
-- Returns: 0 rows (audit triggers not active at time of loss)
```

**Recovery Status:**
‚ùå **NOT RECOVERABLE** - No audit trail exists before the data loss event.  
The audit system was implemented AFTER this incident occurred.

**Required Action:**
Manual data re-entry required. User must:
1. Contact customer (Samuel Rizzo, 0418594790)
2. Retrieve original quote/invoice
3. Re-enter all line items and costs manually

### Case 3: Job 0065 - Previously Recovered
**Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED CORRECT
- Current: Lindsay James, 0403164291
- Recovery performed in previous migration
- Audit trail confirms restoration

## SYSTEMIC ISSUES DISCOVERED

### Calculation Discrepancies (20+ Jobs)

**Pattern:** Stored `grand_total` doesn't include GST (10%), but calculated total does.

**Examples:**
| Job Number | Stored Total | Calculated Total | Difference | Impact |
|------------|--------------|------------------|------------|---------|
| JB2025-0011 | $531.00 | $584.10 | -$53.10 | GST not added |
| JB2025-0044 | $435.00 | $478.50 | -$43.50 | GST not added |
| JB2025-0040 | $421.00 | $463.10 | -$42.10 | GST not added |

**Root Cause:**
- Inconsistent calculation logic between create and update paths
- Some jobs saved before GST calculation was added
- No server-side validation of totals

**Resolution:**
- Created `job_calculated_totals` VIEW for server-side verification
- Added `find_jobs_with_calculation_errors()` function for detection
- Will require batch correction script (separate task)

---

## COMPREHENSIVE FIXES DEPLOYED

### Database Layer

1. **Phone Normalization** ‚úÖ
   - Added `phone_digits` generated column (digits-only)
   - Created unique index on phone_digits (prevents duplicate phones)
   - Merged 10 duplicate phone customers automatically

2. **Schema Hardening** ‚úÖ
   - Added NOT NULL constraints on critical fields:
     - `jobs_db`: job_number, customer_id, machine fields, all monetary fields
     - `customers_db`: name, phone, address
     - `job_parts`: description, quantity, unit_price, total_price
   - Added validation triggers (replaced CHECK constraints):
     - `validate_job_parts_positive()`: qty ‚â• 0, price ‚â• 0

3. **Optimistic Concurrency Control** ‚úÖ
   - Version validation trigger: `check_optimistic_lock()`
   - Applied to `jobs_db` and `customers_db`
   - Returns error code 40001 on conflict (maps to HTTP 409)

4. **Enhanced Audit System** ‚úÖ
   - New trigger: `audit_job_parts_changes()` - tracks all part INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   - All part operations now logged to `audit_log` table
   - Captures who, when, old values, new values, source

5. **Customer Matching** ‚úÖ
   - New function: `find_or_create_customer()` - deterministic matching
   - Priority: exact phone ‚Üí name+email ‚Üí fail if ambiguous
   - Prevents silent customer link changes

6. **Server-Side Validation** ‚úÖ
   - VIEW: `job_calculated_totals` - recomputes totals from source
   - Function: `find_jobs_with_calculation_errors()` - flags discrepancies
   - Function: `find_suspicious_customer_changes()` - audit recent changes

7. **Stabilization Mode** ‚úÖ
   - Table: `system_maintenance_mode` created
   - Status: Read-only for non-admin users
   - Affected tables: customers_db, jobs_db, job_parts, job_payments, invoices, invoice_lines

### Frontend Layer

1. **Optimistic Concurrency** ‚úÖ
   - Updated `storage.ts saveJob()`:
     - Fetches current version before update
     - Uses UPDATE with `WHERE version = $1` (not upsert)
     - Throws clear error on version mismatch

2. **Smart Parts Save** ‚úÖ
   - New method: `saveJobParts()` with safety checks
   - Only processes if parts array explicitly provided
   - Compares existing vs new parts (smart merge, not delete-all)
   - Logs warning if empty array provided

3. **Conflict Resolution UI** ‚úÖ
   - Component: `ConflictResolutionDialog`
   - Options: Reload | Force Overwrite (with reason)
   - Admin-only force overwrite, fully audited

| 0042 | Samuel Rizzo, 0418594790 | N/A | ‚ùå DATA LOST | Requires manual re-entry |

**Recovery Diff:**
```diff
Job 0061:
- customer_id: cc9bbb0a-63cd-4ee4-8bec-8881e8f7a44f (Gaye Moody)
+ customer_id: [new Carrie UUID] (Carrie, 0422408306)
+ company_name: Wood Culture Services
+ Audit: FORENSIC RECOVERY logged

Job 0042:
No recovery possible - audit trail empty (data lost before audit system deployed)
Recommendation: Contact customer for original quote details
```

## TESTING CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ Database Tests
- [x] Optimistic concurrency prevents concurrent overwrites
- [x] Phone normalization prevents duplicate customers
- [x] Validation triggers reject negative quantities/prices
- [x] Audit log captures all part changes
- [x] Balance calculation view flags discrepancies
- [x] Customer matching function prevents ambiguous matches

### Frontend Tests (Required)
- [ ] Conflict dialog appears on version mismatch
- [ ] Parts save skips if array undefined (prevents accidental deletion)
- [ ] Autosave includes version check
- [ ] User can reload on conflict
- [ ] Admin can force overwrite with reason

### Integration Tests (Required)
- [ ] Create job ‚Üí add parts ‚Üí save ‚Üí verify parts persisted
- [ ] Edit job in two tabs ‚Üí second save shows conflict dialog
- [ ] Empty parts array logs warning but allows deletion
- [ ] Undefined parts array skips part update entirely

### E2E Scenarios (Required)
- [ ] Recreate Job 0061 scenario: verify correct customer preserved
- [ ] Recreate Job 0042 scenario: verify parts not deleted on save with undefined array
- [ ] Search by phone/name returns correct unique customer

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Job 0042 Data Unrecoverable**
   - No audit trail exists for the lost data
   - Audit system was deployed AFTER the data loss
   - Manual re-entry required

2. **Historical Calculation Errors**
   - 20+ jobs have GST calculation discrepancies
   - Requires batch correction script (separate task)
   - `job_calculated_totals` view identifies all affected jobs

3. **Stabilization Mode Active**
   - Non-admin users currently in read-only mode
   - Must be disabled after verification complete
   - SQL to disable: `UPDATE system_maintenance_mode SET disabled_at = now()`

4. **Pre-Existing Security Warnings**
   - 23 function search_path warnings (not related to this fix)
   - 1 security definer view warning (pre-existing)
   - Password policy warnings (user-level setting)
