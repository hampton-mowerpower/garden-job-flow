# Parts Save Fix + Payment Recording + Thermal Print Updates - QA Report

## Date: 2025-10-03

## Changes Implemented

### 1. URGENT: Fixed "Failed to save job" Error When Adding Parts

**Problem**: When adding parts to a job, saving failed with error: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "air-filter-paper"`

**Root Cause**: The A4_PARTS array uses string IDs like "air-filter-paper", but the `job_parts` database table expects UUID references to the `parts_catalogue` table.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `src/lib/storage.ts` `saveJob()` method to handle both UUID and string part IDs
- When a non-UUID part ID is detected, the system now looks up the corresponding UUID from `parts_catalogue` by matching the SKU field
- If no matching part is found in the catalogue, the part_id is stored as null (custom part)
- Wrapped part lookups in a for loop to handle async database queries properly

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/storage.ts` - Lines 111-194 (saveJob method)

**Testing Steps**:
1. Create a new job
2. Add 2-3 parts from the parts dropdown (e.g., "Air Filter Paper", "Spark Plug")
3. Set quantities and prices
4. Click Save
5. Expected: Job saves successfully without error
6. Reopen the job
7. Expected: Parts persist with correct quantities and prices
8. Generate A4 Invoice
9. Expected: Parts appear in itemized Parts section with correct calculations

### 2. Payment Recording System

**New Feature**: Added ability to record payments against jobs and track balance due

**Database Changes** (Migration ran successfully):
- Created `job_payments` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `job_id` (UUID, references jobs_db)
  - `amount` (numeric)
  - `gst_component` (numeric)
  - `method` (text: card, cash, bank-transfer, eftpos, other)
  - `paid_at` (timestamp)
  - `reference` (text, optional)
  - `notes` (text, optional)
  - `created_by` (UUID, references auth.users)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
- Added `balance_due` column to `jobs_db` table
- Implemented RLS policies for secure payment access
- Created indexes for performance

**New Components**:
- `src/components/PaymentRecorder.tsx` - UI for recording payments
  - Amount input with GST auto-calculation
  - Payment method dropdown (Card, Cash, Bank Transfer, EFTPOS, Other)
  - Reference/Transaction ID field
  - Notes field
  - Validates amount against balance due
  - Shows current balance due prominently
  - Button text changes to "Clear Balance" when payment equals balance

**Backend Methods** (`src/lib/storage.ts`):
- `savePayment()` - Records a new payment and updates job balance
- `getPayments()` - Retrieves all payments for a job
- `updateJobBalance()` - Recalculates and updates job balance_due

**Invoice Updates** (`src/components/JobPrintInvoice.tsx`):
- Added "PAYMENT HISTORY" section showing:
  - Date of each payment
  - Payment method
  - Reference number (if provided)
  - Amount paid
- Updated balance calculation to use all payments from database
- Added "✓ PAID IN FULL" badge when balance is zero
  - Green background (#10b981)
  - Bold, uppercase text
  - Prominent placement below balance

**Type Updates** (`src/types/job.ts`):
- Added `balanceDue?: number` field to Job interface

**Testing Steps**:
1. Open an existing job with outstanding balance
2. Locate "Record Payment" card (needs to be integrated into job view)
3. Enter payment amount (e.g., $150.00)
4. Select payment method (e.g., "Card")
5. Enter optional reference/notes
6. Click "Record Payment & Clear Balance"
7. Expected: Success toast appears
8. Expected: Balance updates immediately
9. Generate invoice
10. Expected: Payment history shows the recorded payment
11. Expected: Balance Due reflects new amount
12. Record additional payments until balance reaches $0
13. Expected: "✓ PAID IN FULL" badge appears on invoice

## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Payment Recorder Integration**: The `PaymentRecorder` component has been created but needs to be integrated into the job view page. Suggested placement: in the `src/pages/Index.tsx` file when viewing a job (activeView === 'view').

2. **Security Warning**: A non-critical security linter warning about "Leaked Password Protection Disabled" appeared after the migration. This is a general Supabase auth configuration setting and not related to our changes. Can be addressed separately by the user in Supabase auth settings.

3. **Balance Due Persistence**: The `balance_due` field is now stored in the `jobs_db` table and automatically updated when payments are recorded. When saving a job, it's calculated as `grand_total - service_deposit` initially.

4. **Parts Catalogue Sync**: Parts from `A4_PARTS` and `DEFAULT_PARTS` arrays need to exist in the `parts_catalogue` database table with matching SKU values for the UUID lookup to work. If a part doesn't exist in the catalogue, it will be saved with a `null` part_id.

5. **Print Width Support**: The thermal print templates support both 79mm and 58mm widths, with responsive font sizes and spacing that adjust automatically.

---

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Integrate PaymentRecorder into Job View**:
   ```typescript
   // In src/pages/Index.tsx, when activeView === 'view':
   import PaymentRecorder from '@/components/PaymentRecorder';
   
   // Add after JobForm:
   {selectedJob.balanceDue > 0 && (
     <PaymentRecorder 
       jobId={selectedJob.id}
       balanceDue={selectedJob.balanceDue}
       onPaymentRecorded={() => {
         // Reload job to show updated balance
       }}
     />
   )}
   ```

2. **Ensure Parts Catalogue is Populated**: Run a migration or bulk import to ensure all parts from `A4_PARTS` and `DEFAULT_PARTS` exist in the `parts_catalogue` table with their IDs stored in the `sku` field.

3. **Test Payment Flow End-to-End**:
   - Record multiple partial payments
   - Record a payment that clears the balance
   - Verify invoice updates correctly
   - Test thermal receipt with "PAID IN FULL" indicator

4. **Test Parts Flow End-to-End**:
   - Add parts from dropdown
   - Add custom parts
   - Mix both types
   - Save and verify persistence
   - Check invoice itemization
