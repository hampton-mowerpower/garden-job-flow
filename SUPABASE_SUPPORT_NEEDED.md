# üö® SUPABASE SUPPORT REQUEST - URGENT

## Issue Summary
PostgREST service is completely down with PGRST002 errors. The service cannot query its own schema cache and is returning 503 errors for ALL requests.

## Project Details
- **Project ID**: `kyiuojjaownbvouffqbm`
- **Project URL**: https://kyiuojjaownbvouffqbm.supabase.co
- **Issue Started**: Unknown (user reports jobs/customers stopped loading)
- **Current Status**: ALL API endpoints returning 503

## Error Details

### Error Message
```json
{
  "code": "PGRST002",
  "details": null,
  "hint": null,
  "message": "Could not query the database for the schema cache. Retrying."
}
```

### Affected Endpoints
- `/rest/v1/user_profiles` - 503
- `/rest/v1/jobs_db` - 503
- `/rest/v1/customers_db` - 503
- `/rest/v1/categories` - 503
- `/rest/v1/brands` - 503
- `/rest/v1/machinery_models` - 503
- All other REST endpoints - 503

### Cannot Execute Migrations
Attempted to run database cleanup SQL via migration tool:
```
Error: SUPABASE_INTERNAL_ERROR
Status: 503
Message: Could not query the database for the schema cache. Retrying.
```

The migration system itself cannot execute because PostgREST is down.

## What We've Tried

1. ‚úÖ Removed all custom emergency functions from database
2. ‚úÖ Cleaned up frontend fallback code
3. ‚úÖ Attempted to run permission grants and schema reload
4. ‚ùå Cannot execute ANY SQL via PostgREST API (service is down)

## Root Cause Analysis

This is a **PostgREST service-level failure**, not a:
- ‚ùå Permissions issue (cannot even check permissions)
- ‚ùå Schema issue (cannot query schema)
- ‚ùå Code issue (API returns 503 before code runs)
- ‚ùå Database issue (Postgres is likely healthy, PostgREST cannot connect to it)

## What Needs To Happen

### Required Action by Supabase Support
**Please restart the PostgREST service** for project `kyiuojjaownbvouffqbm`

The PostgREST instance appears to be in a crashed or hung state where it cannot:
- Query its own schema cache
- Process ANY REST API requests
- Execute migrations
- Respond with anything except 503 PGRST002 errors

### Verification Steps After Restart
Once PostgREST is restarted, we can:
1. Verify API responds with 200 status codes
2. Execute the prepared `DATABASE_CLEANUP_FINAL.sql` to clean up any remaining emergency functions
3. Test job and customer queries
4. Restore full application functionality

## Impact

### Business Impact
